Any time I work on something that I feel I’ve had to hunt around for information on and that I’ve not really found something that fits what I was looking for I tend to want to write up what I’ve found and put it out there for someone to find – if only because it’s more than likely me that’ll come back later and find it!

To this end I’ve finally got a content publishing tool I like working with and have been trying to put out some stuff out there.

You're welcome to browse around and you'll find hopelessly hopeful drafts of articles and other bobbins and gubbins I want to make sure I don't forget. I'll keep trying to organise them into a structure that makes sense...
