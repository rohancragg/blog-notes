Embarassed that I keep having to DuckDuckGo this but found a really good simple explanation here [How to update a forked repo from an upstream with git rebase (or merge)](https://timonweb.com/misc/how-to-update-a-forked-repo-from-an-upstream-with-git-rebase-or-merge/) another good on I found is [here](https://medium.com/sweetmeat/how-to-keep-a-downstream-git-repository-current-with-upstream-repository-changes-10b76fad6d97)

### Recent Listening

I just rediscovered across this Dub album that was in my collection as a teenager:

## May 2020

I just discovered [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/static-web-apps/overview) - this might well prompt me to migrate away from using GitHub Pages for publishing this site...

Still trying to catch up on some of the news from Microsoft Build 2020

https://mybuild.microsoft.com/
https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2020
https://youtube.com/c/microsoftdeveloper

There was some good coverage here: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/microsofts-romance-with-open-source-software-on-display-at-build-2020/

In terms of training and learning I found that I'd happily already completed 100% on the [Build Cloud Skills Challenge - Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/buildcloudskillschallenge/collections/60j5u7og741dgd). I really need to crack on and re-book an online proctored exam for [Exam AZ-400 - Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/exams/az-400) to finally gain my [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/devops-engineer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/devops-engineer).

A [free exam voucher](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/microsoft-build-cloud-skills-challenge-2020-free-certification-exam-offer) is available for redemption starting June 8, 2020 and is valid until January 31, 2021

My colleage @twitter:d0ugs mode some notes that have prompted me to go back and watch this [Building Azure Apps using the Common Data Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8My4Nh2MUEo)

Also annouced into public preview - [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/overview-what-is) is the 'Data Lakehouse' we've all (apparently) been waiting for: https://youtu.be/HvEi13pWNps - it's an all-in-one studio for everything Data
